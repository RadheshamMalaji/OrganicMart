        <h3>About Us : </h3>
        <p>
          “Organics with love”, My Organic Mart’s slogan, articulates its belief
          that foods that are healthy and holistic in an ethereal sense can only
          be cultivated and produced by healthy, happy people. Organic farming
          practices may reduce pollution, conserve water, reduce soil erosion,
          increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without
          synthetic pesticides is also better for nearby birds and animals as
          well as people who live close to farms.
        </p>
        <p>
          For that reason My Organic Mart considers the welfare of all those
          people who participate in delivering the product. Starting with the
          farmers who stand at the beginning of the value chain, the employees
          who work for its suppliers and all the way to the My Organic Mart ,
          packaging, storage and delivering of our food products.
        </p>
        <p>
          The underlying base for all this are fair and adequate prices that My
          Organic Mart pays and that create adequate value at all levels.
          Frequent visits to its farmers - provide My Organic Mart insights into
          local conditions and help to establish authentic social contacts.
